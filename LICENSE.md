This is free software. The license for the Raylib library aligns with my ideals
quite well and I therefore apply it to this VAPI and quote it below. Most notably
this VAPI took a lot of effort and typing so please don't claim it as your work and
if you use it, a mention would be appreciated, but is not legally required.

Copyright for the Raylib library itself follows...
